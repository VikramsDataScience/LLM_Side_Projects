# Multi Modal AI Side Projects
Hello! I'm Vikram and I'm a Data Scientist. Welcome to my language model side projects repo. 

The intention of this repo is to showcase my learning journey in the world of Deep Learning (or AI, as its colloquially called nowadays). The projects showcased here are either built to the POC stage (at which point they're designated complete), or they're in WIP. The projects are certainly not advanced or intended to be accurate. But they're designed to showcase my learning journey as I playfully explore the beautiful world of AI.

Each project has its own `README.md` file to explain the aim of the project, the methodology used, and the steps necessary to use the Python src modules that have been built to support the project. Please follow these steps if you're interested in either reproducing these results, or if you'd like to use any of the code for your own work!
