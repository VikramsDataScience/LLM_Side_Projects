# LLM Side Projects
Hello! And, welcome to my language model side projects repo. 

The intention of this repo is to showcase my learning journey in the world of language modeling. The projects showcased here are either built to the POC stage (and are designated somewhat complete), or they're in WIP. The projects are certainly not advanced, but are designed to showcase my continuing interest in exploring the beautiful world of AI.

Each project has its own `README.md` file to explain the aim of the project, the methodology used, and the steps necessary to use the Python src components that have been built to support the project. Please follow these steps if anyone's interested in reproducing these results, or if you'd like to use any of the code for your own work!
