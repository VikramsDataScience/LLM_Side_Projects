# ECommerce Customer Churn Propensity Model (WIP)
The dataset I'm working with was sourced from Kaggle. It's a customer dataset from an <a href='https</b>://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction/data'>Ecommerce</a> company that contains anonymised customer ID numbers, and their activity prior to churning. Since, it's a customer churn dataset, it also contains the boolean flag for those customers who did or didn't churn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With this model I'm hoping to develop a churn propensity model that will predict the likelihood of a customer churning based on the activity that's measured in the provided dataset. Obviously the reasons why a customer may decide to cancel their membership with a company is highly prone to confounding factors that may not be measurable. As such, one of the many limitations of such modelling does imply that confounding factors (or variables if they're measurable) can significantly affect the model's predictive accuracy.
